[Intro]

[Verse 2]
Joy to the world, the Savior reigns.
Let all their songs employ.
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
repeat the sounding joy,
repeat the sounding joy,
repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

[Chorus]                                    [Chorus 2]

An overflowing well no tongue can tell.     An overflowing well no tongue can tell.
